Original Code from "Processing real world HTML as if it were XML in scala"
http://www.hars.de/2009/01/html-as-xml-in-scala.html

Currently, only TagSoup is implemented.

Simple usage:

import com.eltimn.scalaxml.TagSoupFactoryAdapter

val xml = (new TagSoupFactoryAdapter).load("http://www.liftweb.net/")
val title = (xml \\ "title").text
assert(title == "Lift Web Framework :: Home")
